**I'm Griffin Caprio**. I'm a husband, father, entrepreneur, and technologist. 

I've done a lot of different things over the years, including consulting CTO, podcaster, [advisor](https://www.topstep.com), and [mentor](http://www.thejuntoinstitute.com).

Feel free to say üëã on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gcaprio), [email](mailto:me@griffincaprio.com?subject=Hi!), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffincaprio/).

Getting people together seems to be a pasttime of mine and I've started groups focused on [CTOs](http://www.chicagoctoforum.com), [Entrepreneurs](http://www.meetup.com/Bootstrappers-Breakfast-Chicago), and [Lean Startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chicago-lean-startup-circle/).

I've been an active OSS developer over the years, notably helping create [Spring.net](http://springframework.net/)
